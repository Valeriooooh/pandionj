# PandionJ
PandionJ is a pedagogical debugger for Java based on [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) that combines static analysis (to classify variables according to their role) and a graphical visualization that mimics "hand drawings" often used by programming instructors (see [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3141880.3141892)). The original prototype was developed by [Hugo Sousa](https://github.com/xplosunn) in the context of his Master Thesis at [Iscte](http://www.iscte-iul.pt). The adoption of PandionJ contributed to improved success in an introductory programming course (see [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3279720.3279732)).
